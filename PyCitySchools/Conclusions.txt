Two main conclusions from PyCitySchools data analysis:

1. There is an inverse relationship between a school's student spending and the school's testing numbers

This is evident in the dataframe where I compare a school's spending and their testing scores in math and reading.
A school that is in the "<$584" range has an overall percentage passing of 90.37% compared to 53.53% for schools in the
top spending range. This must be due to more spending at schools with students who require more support.

2. Charter schools are more successful than district schools

This is evident in the last dataframe where I compare a school's type to its testing scores in math and reading.
A charter school has an overall percentage passing of 90.43% compared to 53.67% for district schools.
