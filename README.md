# Pandas-Challenge
The PyCitySchools directory contains these files:

	* main.ipynb	
	* Resources directory which contains two csv files
	* Conclusion.txt

The main jupyter notebook file contains analysis on a school district's data. This file reads in two cvs files from the Resources folder and creates multiple DataFrames.
These DataFrames are described below.

	A high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
 		* Total Schools
 		* Total Students
 		* Total Budget
 		* Average Math Score
 		* Average Reading Score
 		* % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
 		* % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
 		* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
 		
	An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
		* School Name
		* School Type
		* Total Students
		* Total School Budget
		* Per Student Budget
		* Average Math Score
		* Average Reading Score
		* % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
		* % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
		* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
		
	A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
		* School Name
		* School Type
		* Total Students
		* Total School Budget
		* Per Student Budget
		* Average Math Score
		* Average Reading Score
		* % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
		* % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
		* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
		
	A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
		* School Name
		* School Type
		* Total Students
		* Total School Budget
		* Per Student Budget
		* Average Math Score
		* Average Reading Score
		* % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
		* % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
		* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
		
	A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
	
	A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
	
	A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student).
		* Average Math Score
		* Average Reading Score
		* % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
		* % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
		* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
		
	A table that breaks down school performances based on School Size.
		* Average Math Score
		* Average Reading Score
